Read at your own discretion! I started this game because of Shiratama’s illustrations (furry nekomimi Mare is cute). I suppose it to be a moe VN like Amairo Chocolata. The whole story is about 30~40h. There are almost no romance elements, but many battle scenes and a complex background. Souma, the male protagonist, infiltrates “Academy of Jewelry” as a spy to search for the Philosopher’s Gem Stone. The students here have superpower gem stones called “The Will (Ishi)”. The six boys and girls in their class often quarrel with each other and cooperate together. Their relationship is getting better gradually. A mysterious organization is trying to petrify the whole continent. In order to save the world, they are embroiled in an endless struggle. There is another parallel storyline in which a vampire girl and a human boy are imprisoned by the doctor and develop feelings for each other, and the girl has to suck blood to live. The two seemingly unrelated storylines cross over and finally converge. Things I liked: The plot’s unexpected development. Around chapter 10, Souma suddenly confesses to his friends that he’s not a vampire but a human. The CG displays his friends sucking blood in the cafeteria, and only then did I realize that vampires are the majority. That gave me a shock. I didn’t think of that at all. My worldview was immediately shaken by the plot twist, because the author had been hiding the important fact. The main characters turn against each other in the story. The sudden betrayal of Mare almost kills the whole group, but the main characters don’t give up on saving her from the pervert doctor. Arianna is just like a baka, always believing that friendship can convince Mare. “Why do I need a reason to help my friend?” Arianna said to Mare. Things I didn’t like: The battle scenes are a bit arbitrary. The Chūnibyō lines and repetitive CGs are acceptable. But the pattern is similar. The protagonists fight against one enemy but are always ravaged. When they are almost killed, they suddenly acquire new skills, enhance their superpowers, or are coincidentally rescued by the arrival of reinforcements. In the end, they always win anyway. However, I think it’s not boring, probably because of the enthusiastic BGM and unexpected twists. The characters’ changing minds is confusing. One moment they’re shouting that none of vampires is innocent, the next moment they become good friends with vampires. If you choose to confess love, you will encounter a few heroine-specific dialogues, and unlock additional episodes of H-scenes, separated from the all-ages main story. I have to complain that the lack of emotional foreshadowing makes the confessions seem abrupt. There are almost no character routes. Not enough moe fan service…… The ending. The boss battles are lengthy, and it’s a bore. When the ED plays, the screen cracks, which startles me, then it jumps to the true ending. Returning to the past, becoming a god, and transforming the world into an ideal, peaceful world. I have a vague sense of déjà vu from other works. After knowing the tragic experience of the villains, I feel sympathy. They are the only remaining human beings and instinctively want to eliminate the natural enemy in revenge. Ruby has seen her family drained by vampires, so she’s furious and sad to see that her favourite osananajimi Souma has befriended vampires, and she tries to wake him up. BGM. With Yours and Rebellion Tears are kind of touching. Under attack by the basilisk, Souma is about to abandon dying Arianna, but Arianna screams, “Run, Souma-kun!”, so he shows his evil eye for the first time to save Arianna, despite revealing his identity as a spy. So cool, this scene makes me feel lucky to have started this game. It seems that there’re no particularly impressive lines. Overall, the story of this VN is good. The illustrations are cute.
